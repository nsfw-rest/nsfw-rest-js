# **Deprecated!**
We're happy to announce that nsfw.rest is moving forward into new types of scanners. We've decided to rename it to `unscan` as it's not only nsfw scans anymore. Head over to [unscan.co](https://unscan.co) for the new system. If you are interested in using unscan with node.js check out the following package: [unscan](https://npmjs.org/package/unscan). You can `npm i unscan` to install the new libray.

# nsfw-rest-js
The Node.js library for [nsfw.rest](https://nsfw.rest). nsfw.rest is a free to use NSFW scanning tool which means it can detect adult imagery so you can protect your platform.

## Installation
Simply run the following to install
```cli
# NPM
npm i nsfw-rest-js

# Yarn
yarn add nsfw-rest-js
```
## Usage
Check the `example/` folder. You have to replace the nsfw import with `nsfw-rest-js` instead of `../src/index`.
